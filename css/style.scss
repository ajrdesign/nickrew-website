    Our Story Theme
\*------------------------------------*/
/*!*
* Thank you for purchasing the Our Story theme! I'm glad you chose to tell
* your story in a more engaging and dynamic way than most of the wedding 
* websites out there. To get you started the CSS has been heavily commented
* to let you know exactly how each object works.
*
* This theme is built of the Inuitcss framework which aims to provide a
* skeleton framework for designers to build upon and is extremely flexible.
* If you plan on expanding this theme be sure to read up on the features of
* the Inuitcss framework.
*
* This theme was built using SCSS. The files are included if you want to continue
* using SCSS but just editing the regular CSS file will work just fine as well.

    STYLE.CSS - IGNORE IF YOU ARE NOT USING SCSS
